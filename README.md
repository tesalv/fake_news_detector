# About Fake News Detection Project

This project is the final project of the Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp.



## Overview  
The topic of fake news detection on social media has recently attracted tremendous attention. The basic countermeasure of comparing websites against a list of labeled fake news sources is inflexible, and so a machine learning approach is desirable.  This project uses Machine learning algorithms to detect fake news directly, based on the text content of news articles. 

## Problem Definition
Identify when a certain news article is reliable or fake news. The news article can take a form of a url, text or image and can detect news in english and portugese.
